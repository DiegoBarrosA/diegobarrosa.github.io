# My personal site hosted in Github Pages

Can be found at https://diegobarrosaraya.com/

## Integration and Shared Assets

This is the main landing site for my personal web presence, integrated with:
- [Blog](https://blog.diegobarrosaraya.com/)
- [Docs](https://docs.diegobarrosaraya.com/)

All sites share a unified navigation bar and use a common CSS theme located in the `shared-assets/shared-theme.css` file at the root of the parent repository. This ensures consistent branding and easier updates across all sites.

## Deployment

Deployment is automated using GitHub Actions. On every push to `main`, the site is deployed to GitHub Pages. See `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` for details.
